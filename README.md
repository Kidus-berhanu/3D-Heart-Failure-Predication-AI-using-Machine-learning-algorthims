The concept of the 4D heart refers to a comprehensive, time-sequential representation of a beating heart, showcasing its progression from diastole to systole. This is achieved by creating a series of 3D models that accurately depict the heart's internal structures throughout its rhythmic cycle. Although modern medical imaging technologies, such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), have made it possible to generate detailed 3D data blocks during the cardiac cycle, visualizing the intricate intracardiac processes of a beating heart in 3D still requires segmenting the heart at each phase. This becomes particularly important in cases of dynamic cardiac pathologies, like hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, where a meticulously segmented 4D heart model can be instrumental in devising effective surgical strategies.

Currently, the process of segmenting these images is a laborious, manual task that involves carefully distinguishing the heart from other structures in the scan. Our objective is to streamline this process by automating myocardial wall segmentation throughout the entire cardiac cycle. To achieve this, we plan to create a machine-learning model capable of identifying the heart and generating accurate masks for the given CT images.

Once the segmentation is complete, we will utilize the machine-learning model's output to construct a 4D heart model that captures the heart's dynamic nature. By developing and refining these innovative heart modeling techniques, we aim to propel medical imaging technology to new heights, thereby enhancing diagnostic and surgical planning capabilities in the field of cardiology.
